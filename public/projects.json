Star us on GitHub!\n\n## About\n\nThe Huly Platform is a robust framework designed to accelerate the development of business applications, such as CRM systems. \nThis repository includes several applications, such as Chat, Project Management, CRM, HRM, and ATS. \nVarious teams are building products on top of the Platform, including [Huly](https://huly.io) and [TraceX](https://tracex.co).\n\n![Huly](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/392073243/6d27d5cc-38cd-4d88-affe-bb88b393180c)\n\n## Self-Hosting\n\nIf you're primarily interested in self-hosting Huly without the intention to modify or contribute to its development, please use [huly-selfhost](https://github.com/hcengineering/huly-selfhost). \nThis project offers a convenient method to host Huly using `docker`, designed for ease of use and quick setup. Explore this option to effortlessly enjoy Huly on your own server.\n\n## Activity\n\n![Alt](https://repobeats.axiom.co/api/embed/c42c99e21691fa60ea61b5cdf11c2e0647621534.svg \"Repobeats analytics image\")\n\n## Table of Content\n\n- [Huly Platform](#huly-platform)\n  - [About](#about)\n  - [Self-Hosting](#self-hosting)\n  - [Activity](#activity)\n  - [Table of Content](#table-of-content)\n  - [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)\n  - [Verification](#verification)\n  - [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Build and run](#build-and-run)\n  - [Run in development mode](#run-in-development-mode)\n  - [Update project structure and database](#update-project-structure-and-database)\n  - [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n  - [Build \\& Watch](#build--watch)\n  - [Tests](#tests)\n    - [Unit tests](#unit-tests)\n    - [UI tests](#ui-tests)\n  - [Package publishing](#package-publishing)\n  - [Additional testing](#additional-testing)\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\n- Before proceeding, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:\n  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v20.11.0 is required)\n  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n\n## Verification\n\nTo verify the installation, perform the following checks in your terminal:\n\n- Ensure that the `docker` commands are available:\n  ```bash\n  docker --version\n  docker compose version\n## Fast start\n\n```bash\nsh ./scripts/fast-start.sh\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nYou need Microsoft's [rush](https://rushjs.io) to install application.\n\n1. Install Rush globally using the command:\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g @microsoft/rush\n2. Navigate to the repository root and run the following commands:\n   ```bash\n   rush install\n   rush build\nAlternatively, you can just execute:\n\n```bash\nsh ./scripts/presetup-rush.sh\n```\n\n## Build and run\n\nDevelopment environment setup requires Docker to be installed on system.\n\nSupport is available for both amd64 and arm64 containers on Linux and macOS.\n\n```bash\ncd ./dev/\nrush build    # Will build all the required packages. \n# rush rebuild  # could be used to omit build cache.\nrush bundle   # Will prepare bundles.\nrush package  # Will build all webpack packages.\nrush validate # Will validate all sources with typescript and generate d.ts files required for ts-node execution.\nrush svelte-check # Optional. svelte files validation using svelte-check.\nrush docker:build   # Will build Docker containers for all applications in the local Docker environment.\nrush docker:up # Will set up all the containers\n```\n\nBe aware `rush docker:build` will automatically execute all required phases like build, bundle, package.\n\nAlternatively, you can just execute:\n\n```bash\nsh ./scripts/build.sh\n```\n\nBy default, Docker volumes named dev_db, dev_elastic, and dev_files will be created for the MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and MinIO instances.\n\nBefore you can begin, you need to create a workspace and an account and associate it with the workspace.\n\n```bash\ncd ./tool # dev/tool in the repository root\nrushx run-local create-workspace ws1 -w DevWorkspace # Create workspace\nrushx run-local create-account user1 -p 1234 -f John -l Appleseed # Create account\nrushx run-local configure ws1 --list --enable '*' # Enable all modules, even if they are not yet intended to be used by a wide audience.\nrushx run-local assign-workspace user1 ws1 # Assign workspace to user.\nrushx run-local confirm-email user1 # To allow the creation of additional test workspaces.\n\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can just execute:\n\n```bash\nsh ./scripts/create-workspace.sh\n```\n\nAdd the following line to your /etc/hosts file\n\n```\n127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal\n```\n\nAccessing the URL http://host.docker.internal:8087 will lead you to the app in development mode.\n\nLimitations:\n\n- Local installation does not support sending emails, thus disabling functionalities such as password recovery and email notifications.\n\n## Run in development mode\n\nDevelopment mode allows for live reloading and a smoother development process.\n\n```bash\ncd dev/prod\nrush validate\nrushx dev-server\n```\n\nThen go to http://localhost:8080\n\nClick on \"Login with password\" link on the bottom of the right panel and use the following login credentials:\n\n```plain\nEmail: user1\nPassword: 1234\nWorkspace: ws1\n```\n\n## Update project structure and database\n\nIf the project's structure is updated, it may be necessary to relink and rebuild the projects.\n\n```bash\nrush update\nrush build\n```\n\nIt may also be necessary to upgrade the running database.\n\n```bash\ncd ./dev/tool\nrushx upgrade -f\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf a build fails, but the code is correct, try to delete the [build cache](https://rushjs.io/pages/maintainer/build_cache/) and retry.\n\n```bash\n# from the project root\nrm -rf common/temp/build-cache\n```\n\n## Build & Watch\n\nFor development purpose `rush build:watch` action could be used.\n\nIt includes build and validate phases in watch mode.\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit tests\n\n```bash\nrush test # To execute all tests\n\nrushx test # For individual test execution inside a package directory\n```\n\n### UI tests\n\n```bash\ncd ./tests\nrush build\nrush bundle\nrush docker:build\n## creates test Docker containers and sets up test database\n./prepare.sh\n## runs UI tests\nrushx uitest\n```\n\nTo execute tests in the development environment, please follow these steps:\n\n```bash\ncd ./tests\n./create-local.sh ## use ./restore-local.sh if you only want to restore the workspace to a predefined initial state for sanity.\ncd ./sanity\nrushx dev-uitest # To execute all tests against the development environment.\nrushx dev-debug -g 'pattern' # To execute tests in debug mode with only the matching test pattern.\n```\n\n## Package publishing\n\n```bash\nnode ./common/scripts/bump.js -p projectName\n```\n\n## Additional testing\n\nThis project is tested with BrowserStack.\n\n<sub><sup>&copy; 2024 <a href=\"https://hardcoreeng.com\">Hardcore Engineering Inc</a>.</sup></sub>\n\n"

For your convenience, we have created [connectors](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/detection/core/#detections) for the most popular libraries like Ultralytics, Transformers, or MMDetection.\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport supervision as sv\nfrom ultralytics import YOLO\n\nimage = cv2.imread(...)\nmodel = YOLO(\"yolov8s.pt\")\nresult = model(image)[0]\ndetections = sv.Detections.from_ultralytics(result)\n\nlen(detections)\n# 5\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udc49 more model connectors</summary>\n\n- inference\n\n  Running with [Inference](https://github.com/roboflow/inference) requires a [Roboflow API KEY](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication#retrieve-an-api-key).\n\n  ```python\n  import cv2\n  import supervision as sv\n  from inference import get_model\n\n  image = cv2.imread(...)\n  model = get_model(model_id=\"yolov8s-640\", api_key=<ROBOFLOW API KEY>)\n  result = model.infer(image)[0]\n  detections = sv.Detections.from_inference(result)\n\n  len(detections)\n  # 5\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n### annotators\n\nSupervision offers a wide range of highly customizable [annotators](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/detection/annotators/), allowing you to compose the perfect visualization for your use case.\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport supervision as sv\n\nimage = cv2.imread(...)\ndetections = sv.Detections(...)\n\nbox_annotator = sv.BoxAnnotator()\nannotated_frame = box_annotator.annotate(\n  scene=image.copy(),\n  detections=detections)\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/roboflow/supervision/assets/26109316/691e219c-0565-4403-9218-ab5644f39bce\n\n### datasets\n\nSupervision provides a set of [utils](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/datasets/core/) that allow you to load, split, merge, and save datasets in one of the supported formats.\n\n```python\nimport supervision as sv\nfrom roboflow import Roboflow\n\nproject = Roboflow().workspace(<WORKSPACE_ID>).project(<PROJECT_ID>)\ndataset = project.version(<PROJECT_VERSION>).download(\"coco\")\n\nds = sv.DetectionDataset.from_coco(\n    images_directory_path=f\"{dataset.location}/train\",\n    annotations_path=f\"{dataset.location}/train/_annotations.coco.json\",\n)\n\npath, image, annotation = ds[0]\n    # loads image on demand\n\nfor path, image, annotation in ds:\n    # loads image on demand\n```\n\n<details close>\n<summary>\ud83d\udc49 more dataset utils</summary>\n\n- load\n\n    ```python\n    dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_yolo(\n        images_directory_path=...,\n        annotations_directory_path=...,\n        data_yaml_path=...\n    )\n\n    dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_pascal_voc(\n        images_directory_path=...,\n        annotations_directory_path=...\n    )\n\n    dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_coco(\n        images_directory_path=...,\n        annotations_path=...\n    )\n    ```\n\n- split\n\n    ```python\n    train_dataset, test_dataset = dataset.split(split_ratio=0.7)\n    test_dataset, valid_dataset = test_dataset.split(split_ratio=0.5)\n\n    len(train_dataset), len(test_dataset), len(valid_dataset)\n    # (700, 150, 150)\n    ```\n\n- merge\n\n    ```python\n    ds_1 = sv.DetectionDataset(...)\n    len(ds_1)\n    # 100\n    ds_1.classes\n    # ['dog', 'person']\n\n    ds_2 = sv.DetectionDataset(...)\n    len(ds_2)\n    # 200\n    ds_2.classes\n    # ['cat']\n\n    ds_merged = sv.DetectionDataset.merge([ds_1, ds_2])\n    len(ds_merged)\n    # 300\n    ds_merged.classes\n    # ['cat', 'dog', 'person']\n    ```\n\n- save\n\n    ```python\n    dataset.as_yolo(\n        images_directory_path=...,\n        annotations_directory_path=...,\n        data_yaml_path=...\n    )\n\n    dataset.as_pascal_voc(\n        images_directory_path=...,\n        annotations_directory_path=...\n    )\n\n    dataset.as_coco(\n        images_directory_path=...,\n        annotations_path=...\n    )\n    ```\n\n- convert\n\n    ```python\n    sv.DetectionDataset.from_yolo(\n        images_directory_path=...,\n        annotations_directory_path=...,\n        data_yaml_path=...\n    ).as_pascal_voc(\n        images_directory_path=...,\n        annotations_directory_path=...\n    )\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n## \ud83c\udfac tutorials\n\nWant to learn how to use Supervision?

      "description_long": "GoodbyeDPI \u2014 Deep Packet Inspection circumvention utility\n=========================\n\nThis software designed to bypass Deep Packet Inspection systems found in many Internet Service Providers which block access to certain websites.\n\nIt handles DPI connected using optical splitter or port mirroring (**Passive DPI**) which do not block any data but just replying faster than requested destination, and **Active DPI** connected in sequence.\n\n**Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 or 11** with administrator privileges required.\n\n# Quick start\n\n* **For Russia**: Download [latest version from Releases page](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI/releases), unpack the file and run **1_russia_blacklist_dnsredir.cmd** script.\n* For other countries: Download [latest version from Releases page](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI/releases), unpack the file and run **2_any_country_dnsredir.cmd**.\n\nThese scripts launch GoodbyeDPI in recommended mode with DNS resolver redirection to Yandex DNS on non-standard port (to prevent DNS poisoning).  \nIf it works \u2014 congratulations! You can use it as-is or configure further.\n\n# How to use\n\nDownload [latest version from Releases page](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI/releases) and run.\n\n```\nUsage: goodbyedpi.exe [OPTION...]\n -p          block passive DPI\n -q          block QUIC/HTTP3\n -r          replace Host with hoSt\n -s          remove space between host header and its value\n -m          mix Host header case (test.com -> tEsT.cOm)\n -f <value>  set HTTP fragmentation to value\n -k <value>  enable HTTP persistent (keep-alive) fragmentation and set it to value\n -n          do not wait for first segment ACK when -k is enabled\n -e <value>  set HTTPS fragmentation to value\n -a          additional space between Method and Request-URI (enables -s, may break sites)\n -w          try to find and parse HTTP traffic on all processed ports (not only on port 80)\n --port        <value>    additional TCP port to perform fragmentation on (and HTTP tricks with -w)\n --ip-id       <value>    handle additional IP ID (decimal, drop redirects and TCP RSTs with this ID).\n                          This option can be supplied multiple times.\n --dns-addr    <value>    redirect UDP DNS requests to the supplied IP address (experimental)\n --dns-port    <value>    redirect UDP DNS requests to the supplied port (53 by default)\n --dnsv6-addr  <value>    redirect UDPv6 DNS requests to the supplied IPv6 address (experimental)\n --dnsv6-port  <value>    redirect UDPv6 DNS requests to the supplied port (53 by default)\n --dns-verb               print verbose DNS redirection messages\n --blacklist   <txtfile>  perform circumvention tricks only to host names and subdomains from\n                          supplied text file (HTTP Host/TLS SNI).\n                          This option can be supplied multiple times.\n --allow-no-sni           perform circumvention if TLS SNI can't be detected with --blacklist enabled.\n --frag-by-sni            if SNI is detected in TLS packet, fragment the packet right before SNI value.\n --set-ttl     <value>    activate Fake Request Mode and send it with supplied TTL value.\n                          DANGEROUS! May break websites in unexpected ways. Use with care (or --blacklist).\n --auto-ttl    [a1-a2-m]  activate Fake Request Mode, automatically detect TTL and decrease\n                          it based on a distance. If the distance is shorter than a2, TTL is decreased\n                          by a2. If it's longer, (a1; a2) scale is used with the distance as a weight.\n                          If the resulting TTL is more than m(ax), set it to m.\n                          Default (if set): --auto-ttl 1-4-10. Also sets --min-ttl 3.\n                          DANGEROUS! May break websites in unexpected ways. Use with care (or --blacklist).\n --min-ttl     <value>    minimum TTL distance (128/64 - TTL) for which to send Fake Request\n                          in --set-ttl and --auto-ttl modes.\n --wrong-chksum           activate Fake Request Mode and send it with incorrect TCP checksum.\n                          May not work in a VM or with some routers, but is safer than set-ttl.\n --wrong-seq              activate Fake Request Mode and send it with TCP SEQ/ACK in the past.\n --native-frag            fragment (split) the packets by sending them in smaller packets, without\n                          shrinking the Window Size. Works faster (does not slow down the connection)\n                          and better.\n --reverse-frag           fragment (split) the packets just as --native-frag, but send them in the\n                          reversed order. Works with the websites which could not handle segmented\n                          HTTPS TLS ClientHello (because they receive the TCP flow \"combined\").\n --fake-from-hex <value>  Load fake packets for Fake Request Mode from HEX values (like 1234abcDEF).\n                          This option can be supplied multiple times, in this case each fake packet\n                          would be sent on every request in the command line argument order.\n --fake-with-sni <value>  Generate fake packets for Fake Request Mode with given SNI domain name.\n                          The packets mimic Mozilla Firefox 130 TLS ClientHello packet\n                          (with random generated fake SessionID, key shares and ECH grease).\n                          Can be supplied multiple times for multiple fake packets.\n --fake-gen <value>       Generate random-filled fake packets for Fake Request Mode, value of them\n                          (up to 30).\n --fake-resend <value>    Send each fake packet value number of times.\n                          Default: 1 (send each packet once).\n --max-payload [value]    packets with TCP payload data more than [value] won't be processed.\n                          Use this option to reduce CPU usage by skipping huge amount of data\n                          (like file transfers) in already established sessions.\n                          May skip some huge HTTP requests from being processed.\n                          Default (if set): --max-payload 1200.\n\n\nLEGACY modesets:\n -1          -p -r -s -f 2 -k 2 -n -e 2 (most compatible mode)\n -2          -p -r -s -f 2 -k 2 -n -e 40 (better speed for HTTPS yet still compatible)\n -3          -p -r -s -e 40 (better speed for HTTP and HTTPS)\n -4          -p -r -s (best speed)\n\nModern modesets (more stable, more compatible, faster):\n -5          -f 2 -e 2 --auto-ttl --reverse-frag --max-payload\n -6          -f 2 -e 2 --wrong-seq --reverse-frag --max-payload\n -7          -f 2 -e 2 --wrong-chksum --reverse-frag --max-payload\n -8          -f 2 -e 2 --wrong-seq --wrong-chksum --reverse-frag --max-payload\n -9          -f 2 -e 2 --wrong-seq --wrong-chksum --reverse-frag --max-payload -q (this is the default)\n\n Note: combination of --wrong-seq and --wrong-chksum generates two different fake packets.\n```\n\nTo check if your ISP's DPI could be circumvented, first make sure that your provider does not poison DNS answers by enabling \"Secure DNS (DNS over HTTPS)\" option in your browser.\n\n* **Chrome**: Settings \u2192 [Privacy and security](chrome://settings/security) \u2192 Use secure DNS \u2192 With: NextDNS\n* **Firefox**: [Settings](about:preferences) \u2192 Network Settings \u2192 Enable DNS over HTTPS \u2192 Use provider: NextDNS\n\nThen run the `goodbyedpi.exe` executable without any options. If it works \u2014 congratulations! You can use it as-is or configure further, for example by using `--blacklist` option if the list of blocked websites is known and available for your country.\n\nIf your provider intercepts DNS requests, you may want to use `--dns-addr` option to a public DNS resolver running on non-standard port (such as Yandex DNS `77.88.8.8:1253`) or configure DNS over HTTPS/TLS using third-party applications.\n\nCheck the .cmd scripts and modify it according to your preference and network conditions.\n\n# How does it work\n\n### Passive DPI\n\nMost Passive DPI send HTTP 302 Redirect if you try to access blocked website over HTTP and TCP Reset in case of HTTPS, faster than destination website. Packets sent by DPI usually have IP Identification field equal to `0x0000` or `0x0001`, as seen with Russian providers. These packets, if they redirect you to another website (censorship page), are blocked by GoodbyeDPI.\n\n### Active DPI\n\nActive DPI is more tricky to fool. Currently the software uses 7 methods to circumvent Active DPI:\n\n* TCP-level fragmentation for first data packet\n* TCP-level fragmentation for persistent (keep-alive) HTTP sessions\n* Replacing `Host` header with `hoSt`\n* Removing space between header name and value in `Host` header\n* Adding additional space between HTTP Method (GET, POST etc) and URI\n* Mixing case of Host header value\n* Sending fake HTTP/HTTPS packets with low Time-To-Live value, incorrect checksum or incorrect TCP Sequence/Acknowledgement numbers to fool DPI and prevent delivering them to the destination\n\nThese methods should not break any website as they're fully compatible with TCP and HTTP standards, yet it's sufficient to prevent DPI data classification and to circumvent censorship. Additional space may break some websites, although it's acceptable by HTTP/1.1 specification (see 19.3 Tolerant Applications).\n\nThe program loads WinDivert driver which uses Windows Filtering Platform to set filters and redirect packets to the userspace. It's running as long as console window is visible and terminates when you close the window.\n\n# How to build from source\n\nThis project can be build using **GNU Make** and [**mingw**](https://mingw-w64.org). The only dependency is [WinDivert](https://github.com/basil00/Divert).\n\nTo build x86 exe run:\n\n`make CPREFIX=i686-w64-mingw32- WINDIVERTHEADERS=/path/to/windivert/include WINDIVERTLIBS=/path/to/windivert/x86`\n\nAnd for x86_64:\n\n`make CPREFIX=x86_64-w64-mingw32- BIT64=1 WINDIVERTHEADERS=/path/to/windivert/include WINDIVERTLIBS=/path/to/windivert/amd64`\n\n# How to install as Windows Service\n\nCheck examples in `service_install_russia_blacklist.cmd`, `service_install_russia_blacklist_dnsredir.cmd` and `service_remove.cmd` scripts.\n\nModify them according to your own needs.\n\n# Known issues\n\n* Horribly outdated Windows 7 installations are not able to load WinDivert driver due to missing support for SHA256 digital signatures. Install KB3033929 [x86](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46078)/[x64](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46148), or better, update the whole system using Windows Update.\n* Intel/Qualcomm Killer network cards: `Advanced Stream Detect` in Killer Control Center is incompatible with GoodbyeDPI, [disable it](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI/issues/541#issuecomment-2296038239).\n* QUIC trading software [may interfere with GoodbyeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI/issues/677#issuecomment-2390595606). First start QUIC, then GoodbyeDPI.\n* ~~Some SSL/TLS stacks unable to process fragmented ClientHello packets, and HTTPS websites won't open. Bug: [#4](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI/issues/4), [#64](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI/issues/64).~~ Fragmentation issues are fixed in v0.1.7.\n* ~~ESET Antivirus is incompatible with WinDivert driver [#91](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI/issues/91). This is most probably antivirus bug, not WinDivert.~~\n\n\n# Similar projects\n\n- **[zapret](https://github.com/bol-van/zapret)** by @bol-van (for MacOS, Linux and Windows)\n- **[Green Tunnel](https://github.com/SadeghHayeri/GreenTunnel)** by @SadeghHayeri (for MacOS, Linux and Windows)\n- **[DPI Tunnel CLI](https://github.com/nomoresat/DPITunnel-cli)** by @zhenyolka (for Linux and routers)\n- **[DPI Tunnel for Android](https://github.com/nomoresat/DPITunnel-android)** by @zhenyolka (for Android)\n- **[PowerTunnel](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel)** by @krlvm (for Windows, MacOS and Linux)\n- **[PowerTunnel for Android](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel-Android)** by @krlvm (for Android)\n- **[SpoofDPI](https://github.com/xvzc/SpoofDPI)** by @xvzc (for macOS and Linux)\n- **[SpoofDPI-Platform](https://github.com/r3pr3ss10n/SpoofDPI-Platform)** by @r3pr3ss10n (for Android, macOS, Windows)\n- **[GhosTCP](https://github.com/macronut/ghostcp)** by @macronut (for Windows)\n- **[ByeDPI](https://github.com/hufrea/byedpi)** for Linux/Windows + **[ByeDPIAndroid](https://github.com/dovecoteescapee/ByeDPIAndroid/)** for Android (no root)\n- **[youtubeUnblock](https://github.com/Waujito/youtubeUnblock/)** by @Waujito (for OpenWRT/Entware routers and Linux)\n\n# Kudos\n\nThanks @basil00 for [WinDivert](https://github.com/basil00/Divert).

Feedback, issues, and PRs are highly\nappreciated.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Host your own document QA (RAG) web-UI**. Support multi-user login, organize your files in private / public collections, collaborate and share your favorite chat with others.\n\n- **Organize your LLM & Embedding models**. Support both local LLMs & popular API providers (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, Groq).\n\n- **Hybrid RAG pipeline**. Sane default RAG pipeline with hybrid (full-text & vector) retriever + re-ranking to ensure best retrieval quality.\n\n- **Multi-modal QA support**. Perform Question Answering on multiple documents with figures & tables support. Support multi-modal document parsing (selectable options on UI).\n\n- **Advance citations with document preview**. By default the system will provide detailed citations to ensure the correctness of LLM answers. View your citations (incl. relevant score) directly in the _in-browser PDF viewer_ with highlights. Warning when retrieval pipeline return low relevant articles.\n\n- **Support complex reasoning methods**. Use question decomposition to answer your complex / multi-hop question. Support agent-based reasoning with ReAct, ReWOO and other agents.\n\n- **Configurable settings UI**. You can adjust most important aspects of retrieval & generation process on the UI (incl. prompts).\n\n- **Extensible**. Being built on Gradio, you are free to customize / add any UI elements as you like. Also, we aim to support multiple strategies for document indexing & retrieval. `GraphRAG` indexing pipeline is provided as an example.\n\n![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/preview.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n### For end users\n\nThis document is intended for developers. If you just want to install and use the app as\nit is, please follow the non-technical [User Guide](https://cinnamon.github.io/kotaemon/).\nUse the most recent release `.zip` to include latest features and bug-fixes.\n\n### For developers\n\n#### System requirements\n\n1. Python >=3.10\n2. (optional) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n\n##### If you would like to process files other than .pdf, .html, .mhtml, and .xlsx documents\n\nYou will need to install the system dependencies of [unstructured](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/installation/full-installation#full-installation). The installations vary by operating system, so please go to the link and follow the instructions there.\n\n#### With Docker (recommended)\n\nWe support both `lite` & `full` version of Docker images. With `full`, the extra packages of `unstructured` will be installed as\nwell, it can support additional file types (.doc, .docx, ...) but the cost is larger docker image size. For most users, the `lite` image should work well in most cases.\n\n- To use the `lite` version.\n\n```\ndocker run \\\n-e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \\\n-e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \\\n-p 7860:7860 -it --rm \\\nghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite\n```\n\n- To use the `full` version.\n\n```\ndocker run \\\n-e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \\\n-e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \\\n-p 7860:7860 -it --rm \\\nghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-full\n```\n\nCurrently, two platforms: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (for newer Mac) are provided & tested. User can specify the platform by passing `--platform` in the docker run command. For example:\n\n```\n# To run docker with platform linux/arm64\ndocker run \\\n-e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \\\n-e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \\\n-p 7860:7860 -it --rm \\\n--platform linux/arm64 \\\nghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite\n```\n\nIf everything is set up fine, navigate to `http://localhost:7860/` to access the web UI.\n\nWe use [GHCR](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) to store docker images, all images can be found [here.](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/pkgs/container/kotaemon)\n\n#### Without Docker\n\n- Clone and install required packages on a fresh python environment.\n\n```shell\n# optional (setup env)\nconda create -n kotaemon python=3.10\nconda activate kotaemon\n\n# clone this repo\ngit clone https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon\ncd kotaemon\n\npip install -e \"libs/kotaemon[all]\"\npip install -e \"libs/ktem\"\n\n```\n\n- Create a .env file in the root of this project. Use .env.example as a template\n\nThe .env file is there to serve use cases where users want to pre-config the models before starting up the app (e.g. deploy the app on HF hub). The file will only be used to populate the db once upon the first run, it will no longer be used in consequent runs.\n\n- (Optional) To enable in-browser PDF_JS viewer, download [PDF_JS_DIST](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/releases/download/v4.0.379/pdfjs-4.0.379-dist.zip) and extract it to `libs/ktem/ktem/assets/prebuilt`\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/pdf-viewer-setup.png\" alt=\"pdf-setup\" width=\"300\">\n\n- Start the web server:\n\n```shell\npython app.py\n```\n\nThe app will be automatically launched in your browser.\n\nDefault username / password are: `admin` / `admin`. You can setup additional users directly on the UI.\n\n![Chat tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/chat-tab.png)\n\n- Check the Resources tab and LLMs and Embeddings and ensure that your `api_key` value is set correctly from your `.env`. file. If it is not set, you can set it here.\n\n## Setup local models (for local / private RAG)\n\nSee [Local model setup](docs/local_model.md).\n\n## Customize your application\n\nBy default, all application data are stored in `./ktem_app_data` folder. You can backup or copy this folder to move your installation to a new machine.\n\nFor advance users or specific use-cases, you can customize those files:\n\n- `flowsettings.py`\n- `.env`\n\n### `flowsettings.py`\n\nThis file contains the configuration of your application. You can use the example\n[here](flowsettings.py) as the\nstarting point.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Notable settings</summary>\n\n```\n# setup your preferred document store (with full-text search capabilities)\nKH_DOCSTORE=(Elasticsearch | LanceDB | SimpleFileDocumentStore)\n\n# setup your preferred vectorstore (for vector-based search)\nKH_VECTORSTORE=(ChromaDB | LanceDB | InMemory | Qdrant)\n\n# Enable / disable multimodal QA\nKH_REASONINGS_USE_MULTIMODAL=True\n\n# Setup your new reasoning pipeline or modify existing one.\nKH_REASONINGS = [\n    \"ktem.reasoning.simple.FullQAPipeline\",\n    \"ktem.reasoning.simple.FullDecomposeQAPipeline\",\n    \"ktem.reasoning.react.ReactAgentPipeline\",\n    \"ktem.reasoning.rewoo.RewooAgentPipeline\",\n]\n)\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### `.env`\n\nThis file provides another way to configure your models and credentials.\n\n<details markdown>\n\n<summary>Configure model via the .env file</summary>\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the models via the `.env` file with the information needed to connect to the LLMs. This file is located in\nthe folder of the application. If you don't see it, you can create one.\n\nCurrently, the following providers are supported:\n\n#### OpenAI\n\nIn the `.env` file, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable with your OpenAI API key in order\nto enable access to OpenAI's models. There are other variables that can be modified,\nplease feel free to edit them to fit your case. Otherwise, the default parameter should\nwork for most people.\n\n```shell\nOPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1\nOPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key here>\nOPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo\nOPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002\n```\n\n#### Azure OpenAI\n\nFor OpenAI models via Azure platform, you need to provide your Azure endpoint and API\nkey. Your might also need to provide your developments' name for the chat model and the\nembedding model depending on how you set up Azure development.\n\n```shell\nAZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=\nAZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=\nOPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview\nAZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-35-turbo\nAZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT=text-embedding-ada-002\n```\n\n#### Local models\n\n##### Using ollama OpenAI compatible server\n\nInstall [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and start the application.\n\nPull your model (e.g):\n\n```\nollama pull llama3.1:8b\nollama pull nomic-embed-text\n```\n\nSet the model names on web UI and make it as default.\n\n![Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/models.png)\n\n##### Using GGUF with llama-cpp-python\n\nYou can search and download a LLM to be ran locally from the [Hugging Face\nHub](https://huggingface.co/models). Currently, these model formats are supported:\n\n- GGUF\n\nYou should choose a model whose size is less than your device's memory and should leave\nabout 2 GB. For example, if you have 16 GB of RAM in total, of which 12 GB is available,\nthen you should choose a model that takes up at most 10 GB of RAM. Bigger models tend to\ngive better generation but also take more processing time.\n\nHere are some recommendations and their size in memory:\n\n- [Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/qwen1_5-1_8b-chat-q8_0.gguf?download=true):\n  around 2 GB\n\nAdd a new LlamaCpp model with the provided model name on the web uI.\n\n</details>\n\n## Adding your own RAG pipeline\n\n#### Custom reasoning pipeline\n\nFirst, check the default pipeline implementation in\n[here](libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/simple.py). You can make quick adjustment to how the default QA pipeline work.\n\nNext, if you feel comfortable adding new pipeline, add new `.py` implementation in `libs/ktem/ktem/reasoning/` and later include it in `flowssettings` to enable it on the UI.\n\n#### Custom indexing pipeline\n\nCheck sample implementation in `libs/ktem/ktem/index/file/graph`\n\n(more instruction WIP).\n\n## Developer guide\n\nPlease refer to the [Developer Guide](https://cinnamon.github.io/kotaemon/development/)\nfor more details.\n\n## Star History\n\n<a href=\"https://star-history.com/#Cinnamon/kotaemon&Date\">\n <picture>\n   <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=Cinnamon/kotaemon&type=Date&theme=dark\" />\n   <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=Cinnamon/kotaemon&type=Date\" />\n   <img alt=\"Star History Chart\" src=\"https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=Cinnamon/kotaemon&type=Date\" />\n </picture>\n</a>\n"

(It's recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node with the proper version)\n\nInstall project dependencies:\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\nDownload the music files and pack all the game assets:\n```\nnpm run download-music\nnpm run assetpack\n```\n\nGame files are ready, now you need to configure two things: the database (MongoDB), and the authentication provider (Firebase).\n\nPokemon Auto Chess use mongoDB to store its data and Firebase for authentication. Those 2 dependencies requires credentials to use. Credentials will be stored in a `.env` file in the root folder of the repository. If you do not have a `.env` file in your root repository, make one now and open it in notepad.\n\n### MongoDB\n\nYou can either setup the mongo database using the cloud based [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) or using the [local installation](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).\n\nIn both cases, create a database named `dev` with an empty collection named `botv2`. Then retrieve the URI connection. \n\nIf you are using MongoDB Cloud, you may need to create an admin user under Database Access > Create a New User. Make sure to Add Built-in Role > Atlas admin.\n\n- A cloud uri will look like smth `mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/dev?retryWrites=true&w=majority`.\n- The local uri will look smth like `mongodb://localhost:27017/dev`.\n\nIn order to play against bots, you will need to load bots data into your newly created database. In MongoDB Compass, import bots data (`./db-commmands/botv2.json`) in the `botV2` empty collection.\n\nIn the `.env` file at the root folder, add the mongoDB URI:\n\n```\nMONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/dev\n```\n\n### Firebase\n\nPokemon Auto Chess uses the Firebase authentication module to let players create accounts and login to the game.\n\nFirst create an account and a firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).\n\nInside the firebase project, create a web app called for example `pokemon-auto-chess-test`.\n\nAdd your newly created firebase config in `.env`. All those credentials should be available in the \"Configure SDK\" section.\n\n```\nFIREBASE_API_KEY=<firebase_api_key>\nFIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<firebase_auth_domain>\nFIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<firebase_project_id>\nFIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<firebase_storage_bucket>\nFIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<firebase_messaging_sender_id>\nFIREBASE_APP_ID=<firebase_app_id>\n```\n\nThen setup the authentication module. In sign in methods, only choose mail/password and anonymous. \n\nYou need to generate a SDK Admin Firebase private key for the server to be able to connect as administrator of the firebase project.\n\nThis option is available in Project settings > Service accounts\n\nThe private key is a json that contain those informations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"<type>\",\n  \"project_id\": \"<project_id>\",\n  \"private_key_id\": \"<private_key_id>\",\n  \"private_key\": \"<private_key>\",\n  \"client_email\": \"<client_email>\",\n  \"client_id\": \"<client_id>\",\n  \"auth_uri\": \"<auth_uri>\",\n  \"token_uri\": \"<token_uri>\",\n  \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"<auth_provider_x509_cert_url>\",\n  \"client_x509_cert_url\": \"<client_x509_cert_url>\",\n  \"universe_domain\": \"<universe_domain>\"\n}\n```\n\nAdd those informations to the `.env`\n\n```\nFIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=<client_email>\nFIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key>\n```\n\nAnd you are done for the configuration part. Now you should be able to run the game locally ! \n\n### Run the game\n\nMake sure you did all the previous steps correctly.\n\nTo start the development server on your machine:\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nGame should run locally on port [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)\n\nDevelopment server is useful to quickly test your configuration and work on modifications to the game code. But it's not fully optimized for production.\n\nTo make the project production ready, first build the project with:\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis task is typically done in Continuous Integration tools.\n\nThen deploy the built files and run the project on your production machine with this command:\n```\nnpm run start\n```\n\n### Administration rights\n\nYou might want to have full access rights on your local version. To do so, you can set your role to `ADMIN` by editing your player rights in the `usermetadatas` table.\n\n# Development\n\n- Assets are automatically packed from `public/src/assets` to `public/dist/client/assets` with assetpack: `npm run assetpack` ; You will need to run assetpack everytime you change the assets\n- The game use precomputed data stored in `app/models/precomputed` folder ; You will need to run `npm run precompute` everytime you change pokemon or synergy data\n- We recommend VSCode and these extensions: Biome for formatting and linting and Inlang for translations management.\n\n## How to deploy your own Pokemon Auto Chess\n\nSee this [README](https://github.com/keldaanCommunity/pokemonAutoChess/blob/master/deployment/README.md)\n\n## Internationalisation\n\n- In VSCode, use the inlang (i18n) extension\n- Bind the Inlang: Extract Message on a keyboard touch, for example (\u00b2)\n- Select the string you want to translate. Press \u00b2, a prompt will ask the id you want for this string. It'll add the corresponding entry in the english translation file.\n- Once you are finished, you can run npm run translate to machine translate the missing translations\n\nPlease note that we only support the english language. Other languages are managed by the community.\n"

It lets you label data types like audio, text, images, videos, and time series with a simple and straightforward UI and export to various model formats. It can be used to prepare raw data or improve existing training data to get more accurate ML models.\n\n- [Try out Label Studio](#try-out-label-studio)\n- [What you get from Label Studio](#what-you-get-from-label-studio)\n- [Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio](#included-templates-for-labeling-data-in-label-studio)\n- [Set up machine learning models with Label Studio](#set-up-machine-learning-models-with-Label-Studio)\n- [Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools](#integrate-label-studio-with-your-existing-tools)\n\n![Gif of Label Studio annotating different types of data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/annotation_examples.gif)\n\nHave a custom dataset? You can customize Label Studio to fit your needs. Read an [introductory blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-label-studio-a-swiss-army-knife-of-data-labeling-140c1be92881) to learn more. \n\n## Try out Label Studio\n\nInstall Label Studio locally, or deploy it in a cloud instance. [Or, sign up for a free trial of our Enterprise edition.](https://heartex.com/free-trial).\n\n- [Install locally with Docker](#install-locally-with-docker)\n- [Run with Docker Compose (Label Studio + Nginx + PostgreSQL)](#run-with-docker-compose)\n- [Install locally with pip](#install-locally-with-pip)\n- [Install locally with poetry](#install-locally-with-poetry)\n- [Install locally with Anaconda](#install-locally-with-anaconda)\n- [Install for local development](#install-for-local-development)\n- [Deploy in a cloud instance](#deploy-in-a-cloud-instance)\n\n### Install locally with Docker\nOfficial Label Studio docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/heartexlabs/label-studio) and it can be downloaded with `docker pull`. \nRun Label Studio in a Docker container and access it at `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n\n```bash\ndocker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest\ndocker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest\n```\nYou can find all the generated assets, including SQLite3 database storage `label_studio.sqlite3` and uploaded files, in the `./mydata` directory.\n\n#### Override default Docker install\nYou can override the default launch command by appending the new arguments:\n```bash\ndocker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/mydata:/label-studio/data heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio --log-level DEBUG\n```\n\n#### Build a local image with Docker\nIf you want to build a local image, run:\n```bash\ndocker build -t heartexlabs/label-studio:latest .\n```\n\n### Run with Docker Compose\nDocker Compose script provides production-ready stack consisting of the following components:\n\n- Label Studio\n- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - proxy web server used to load various static data, including uploaded audio, images, etc.\n- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - production-ready database that replaces less performant SQLite3.\n\nTo start using the app from `http://localhost` run this command:\n```bash\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\n### Run with Docker Compose + MinIO\nYou can also run it with an additional MinIO server for local S3 storage. This is particularly useful when you want to \ntest the behavior with S3 storage on your local system. To start Label Studio in this way, you need to run the following command:\n````bash\n# Add sudo on Linux if you are not a member of the docker group\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.minio.yml up -d\n````\nIf you do not have a static IP address, you must create an entry in your hosts file so that both Label Studio and your \nbrowser can access the MinIO server. For more detailed instructions, please refer to [our guide on storing data](docs/source/guide/storedata.md).\n\n\n### Install locally with pip\n\n```bash\n# Requires Python >=3.8\npip install label-studio\n\n# Start the server at http://localhost:8080\nlabel-studio\n```\n\n### Install locally with poetry\n\n```bash\n### install poetry\npip install poetry\n\n### set poetry environment\npoetry new my-label-studio\ncd my-label-studio\npoetry add label-studio\n\n### activate poetry environment\npoetry shell\n\n### Start the server at http://localhost:8080\nlabel-studio\n```\n\n### Install locally with Anaconda\n\n```bash\nconda create --name label-studio\nconda activate label-studio\nconda install psycopg2\npip install label-studio\n```\n\n### Install for local development\n\nYou can run the latest Label Studio version locally without installing the package from pypi. \n\n```bash\n# Install all package dependencies\npip install poetry\npoetry install\n# Run database migrations\npython label_studio/manage.py migrate\npython label_studio/manage.py collectstatic\n# Start the server in development mode at http://localhost:8080\npython label_studio/manage.py runserver\n```\n\n### Deploy in a cloud instance\n\nYou can deploy Label Studio with one click in Heroku, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: \n\n[<img src=\"https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg\" height=\"30px\">](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/tree/heroku-persistent-pg)\n[<img src=\"https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton\" height=\"30px\">](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fheartexlabs%2Flabel-studio%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)\n[<img src=\"https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg\" height=\"30px\">](https://deploy.cloud.run)\n\n\n#### Apply frontend changes\n\nFor information about updating the frontend, see [label-studio/web/README.md](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/develop/web/README.md#installation-instructions).\n\n\n#### Install dependencies on Windows \nTo run Label Studio on Windows, download and install the following wheel packages from [Gohlke builds](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) to ensure you're using the correct version of Python:\n- [lxml](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml)\n\n```bash\n# Upgrade pip \npip install -U pip\n\n# If you're running Win64 with Python 3.8, install the packages downloaded from Gohlke:\npip install lxml\u20114.5.0\u2011cp38\u2011cp38\u2011win_amd64.whl\n\n# Install label studio\npip install label-studio\n```\n\n### Run test suite\nTo add the tests' dependencies to your local install:\n\n```bash\npoetry install --with test\n```\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to run the unit tests from a Docker container in which the test dependencies are installed:\n\n\n```bash\nmake build-testing-image\nmake docker-testing-shell\n```\n\nIn either case, to run the unit tests:\n\n```bash\ncd label_studio\n\n# sqlite3\nDJANGO_DB=sqlite DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio pytest -vv\n\n# postgres (assumes default postgres user,db,pass. Will not work in Docker\n# testing container without additional configuration)\nDJANGO_DB=default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.label_studio pytest -vv\n```\n \n## What you get from Label Studio\n\n![Screenshot of Label Studio data manager grid view with images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/labelstudio-ui.gif)\n\n- **Multi-user labeling** sign up and login, when you create an annotation it's tied to your account.\n- **Multiple projects** to work on all your datasets in one instance.\n- **Streamlined design** helps you focus on your task, not how to use the software.\n- **Configurable label formats** let you customize the visual interface to meet your specific labeling needs.\n- **Support for multiple data types** including images, audio, text, HTML, time-series, and video. \n- **Import from files or from cloud storage** in Amazon AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or JSON, CSV, TSV, RAR, and ZIP archives. \n- **Integration with machine learning models** so that you can visualize and compare predictions from different models and perform pre-labeling.\n- **Embed it in your data pipeline** REST API makes it easy to make it a part of your pipeline\n\n## Included templates for labeling data in Label Studio \n\nLabel Studio includes a variety of templates to help you label your data, or you can create your own using specifically designed configuration language. The most common templates and use cases for labeling include the following cases:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/master/images/templates-categories.jpg\" />\n\n## Set up machine learning models with Label Studio\n\nConnect your favorite machine learning model using the Label Studio Machine Learning SDK. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Start your own machine learning backend server. See [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-ml-backend).\n2. Connect Label Studio to the server on the model page found in project settings.\n\nThis lets you:\n\n- **Pre-label** your data using model predictions. \n- Do **online learning** and retrain your model while new annotations are being created. \n- Do **active learning** by labeling only the most complex examples in your data.\n\n## Integrate Label Studio with your existing tools\n\nYou can use Label Studio as an independent part of your machine learning workflow or integrate the frontend or backend into your existing tools.  \n\n## Ecosystem\n\n| Project | Description |\n|-|-|\n| label-studio | Server, distributed as a pip package |\n| [Frontend library](web/libs/editor/) | The Label Studio frontend library.

      "description_long": "Hibernate ORM is a powerful object/relational mapping solution for Java, and makes it easy to develop persistence logic for applications, libraries, and frameworks.\n\nHibernate implements JPA, the standard API for object/relational persistence in Java, but also offers an extensive set of features and APIs which go beyond the specification.\n\nSee https://hibernate.org/orm/[Hibernate.org] for more information.\n\nimage:https://ci.hibernate.org/job/hibernate-orm-pipeline/job/main/badge/icon[Build Status,link=https://ci.hibernate.org/job/hibernate-orm-pipeline/job/main/]\nimage:https://img.shields.io/badge/Revved%20up%20by-Develocity-06A0CE?logo=Gradle&labelColor=02303A[link=https://ge.hibernate.org/scans]\n\n== Continuous Integration\n\nHibernate uses both https://jenkins-ci.org[Jenkins] and https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Actions]\nfor its CI needs. See\n\n* https://ci.hibernate.org/view/ORM/[Jenkins Jobs]\n* https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/actions[GitHub Actions Jobs]\n\n== Building from sources\n\nThe build requires at least Java 11 and at most Java 17.\n\nHibernate uses https://gradle.org[Gradle] as its build tool. See the _Gradle Primer_ section below if you are new to\nGradle.\n\nContributors should read the link:CONTRIBUTING.md[Contributing Guide].\n\nSee the guides for setting up https://hibernate.org/community/contribute/intellij-idea/[IntelliJ] or\nhttps://hibernate.org/community/contribute/eclipse-ide/[Eclipse] as your development environment.\n\n== Gradle Primer\n\nThe Gradle build tool has amazing documentation.  2 in particular that are indispensable:\n\n* https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide_single.html[Gradle User Guide] is a typical user guide in that\nit follows a topical approach to describing all of the capabilities of Gradle.\n* https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/index.html[Gradle DSL Guide] is unique and excellent in quickly\ngetting up to speed on certain aspects of Gradle.\n\nWe will cover the basics developers and contributors new to Gradle need to know to get productive quickly.\n\nNOTE: The project defines a https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper].\nThe rest of the section will assume execution through the wrapper.\n\n=== Executing Tasks\n\nGradle uses the concept of build tasks (equivalent to Ant targets or Maven phases/goals). You can get a list of\navailable tasks via \n\n----\ngradle tasks\n----\n\nTo execute a task across all modules, simply perform that task from the root directory. Gradle will visit each\nsub-project and execute that task if the sub-project defines it. To execute a task in a specific module you can\neither:\n\n. `cd` into that module directory and execute the task\n. name the \"task path\". For example, to run the tests for the _hibernate-core_ module from the root directory\nyou could say `gradle hibernate-core:test`\n\n=== Common tasks\n\nThe common tasks you might use in building Hibernate include:\n\n* _build_ - Assembles (jars) and tests this project\n* _compile_ - Performs all compilation tasks including staging resources from both main and test\n* _jar_ - Generates a jar archive with all the compiled classes\n* _test_ - Runs the tests\n* _publishToMavenLocal_ - Installs the project jar to your local maven cache (aka ~/.m2/repository). Note that Gradle\nnever uses this, but it can be useful for testing your build with other local Maven-based builds.\n* _clean_ - Cleans the build directory\n\n== Testing and databases\n\nTesting against a specific database can be achieved in 2 different ways:\n\n=== Using the \"Matrix Testing Plugin\" for Gradle.\n\nComing later\u2026\n\n=== Using \"profiles\"\n\nThe Hibernate build defines several database testing \"profiles\" in `databases.gradle`. These\nprofiles can be activated by name using the `db` build property which can be passed either as\na JVM system prop (`-D`) or as a Gradle project property (`-P`). Examples below use the Gradle\nproject property approach.\n\n----\ngradle clean build -Pdb=pgsql\n----\n\nTo run a test from your IDE, you need to ensure the property expansions happen.\nUse the following command:\n\n----\ngradle clean compile -Pdb=pgsql\n----\n\n__NOTE: If you are running tests against a JDBC driver that is not available via Maven central be sure to\nadd these drivers to your local Maven repo cache (~/.m2/repository) or (better) add it to a personal Maven repo server__\n\n=== Running database-specific tests from the IDE using \"profiles\"\n\nYou can run any test on any particular database that is configured in a `databases.gradle` profile.\n\nAll you have to do is run the following command:\n\n----\n./gradlew setDataBase -Pdb=pgsql\n----\n\nor you can use the shortcut version: \n\n----\n./gradlew sDB -Pdb=pgsql\n----\n\nYou can do this from the module which you are interested in testing or from the `hibernate-orm` root folder.\n\nAfterward, just pick any test from the IDE and run it as usual. Hibernate will pick the database configuration from the `hibernate.properties`\nfile that was set up by the `setDataBase` Gradle task.\n\n=== Starting test databases locally as docker containers\n\nYou don't have to install all databases locally to be able to test against them in case you have docker available.\nThe script `docker_db.sh` allows you to start a pre-configured database which can be used for testing.\n\nAll you have to do is run the following command:\n\n----\n./docker_db.sh postgresql\n----\n\nomitting the argument will print a list of possible options.\n\nWhen the database is properly started, you can run tests with special profiles that are suffixed with `_ci`\ne.g. `pgsql_ci` for PostgreSQL. By using the system property `dbHost` you can configure the IP address of your docker host.\n\nThe command for running tests could look like the following:\n\n----\n./gradlew test -Pdb=pgsql_ci \"-DdbHost=192.168.99.100\"\n----\n\nThe following table illustrates a list of commands for various databases that can be tested locally.\n\n|===\n|Database |`docker_db.sh` |Gradle command\n\n|H2\n|-\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=h2`\n\n|HSQLDB\n|-\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=hsqldb`\n\n|Apache Derby\n|-\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=derby`\n\n|MySQL\n|`./docker_db.sh mysql`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=mysql_ci`\n\n|MariaDB\n|`./docker_db.sh mariadb`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=mariadb_ci`\n\n|PostgreSQL\n|`./docker_db.sh postgresql`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=pgsql_ci`\n\n|EnterpriseDB\n|`./docker_db.sh edb`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=edb_ci`\n\n|Oracle\n|`./docker_db.sh oracle`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=oracle_ci`\n\n|DB2\n|`./docker_db.sh db2`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=db2_ci`\n\n|SQL Server\n|`./docker_db.sh mssql`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=mssql_ci`\n\n|Sybase ASE (jTDS)\n|`./docker_db.sh sybase`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=sybase_ci`\n\n|Sybase ASE (jConnect)\n|`./docker_db.sh sybase`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=sybase_jconn_ci`\n\n|SAP HANA\n|`./docker_db.sh hana`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=hana_ci`\n\n|CockroachDB\n|`./docker_db.sh cockroachdb`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=cockroachdb`\n\n|TiDB\n|`./docker_db.sh tidb`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=tidb`\n\n|Informix\n|`./docker_db.sh informix`\n|`./gradlew test -Pdb=informix`\n|===\n\nTo stop a container started by `docker`, use the command\n\n[source]\n----\ndocker stop $container_name\n----\n\nNOTE:: Substitute `podman` command for `docker` if using `podman`\n\nE.g., to stop the mariadb container\n\n[source]\n----\ndocker stop mariadb\n----\n"

Check out [AgentsJS](https://github.com/livekit/agents-js)\n\n## \u2728 [NEW] OpenAI Realtime API support\n\nWe're partnering with OpenAI on a new `MultimodalAgent` API in the Agents framework. This class completely wraps OpenAI\u2019s Realtime API, abstract away the raw wire protocol, and provide an ultra-low latency WebRTC transport between GPT-4o and your users\u2019 devices. This same stack powers Advanced Voice in the ChatGPT app.\n\n- Try the Realtime API in our [playground](https://playground.livekit.io/) [[code](https://github.com/livekit-examples/realtime-playground)]\n- Check out our [guide](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/openai) to building your first app with this new API\n\n## What is Agents?\n\nThe Agents framework allows you to build AI-driven server programs that can see, hear, and speak in realtime. Your agent connects with end user devices through a LiveKit session. During that session, your agent can process text, audio, images, or video streaming from a user's device, and have an AI model generate any combination of those same modalities as output, and stream them back to the user. \n\n## Features\n\n- Plugins for popular LLMs, transcription and text-to-speech services, and RAG databases\n- High-level abstractions for building voice agents or assistants with automatic turn detection, interruption handling, function calling, and transcriptions\n- Compatible with LiveKit's [telephony stack](https://github.com/livekit/sip), allowing your agent to make calls to or receive calls from phones\n- Integrated load balancing system that manages pools of agents with edge-based dispatch, monitoring, and transparent failover\n- Running your agents is identical across localhost, [self-hosted](https://github.com/livekit/livekit), and [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io) environments\n\n<!--END_DESCRIPTION-->\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the core Agents library:\n\n```bash\npip install livekit-agents\n```\n\n## Plugins\n\nThe framework includes a variety of plugins that make it easy to process streaming input or generate output. For example, there are plugins for converting text-to-speech or running inference with popular LLMs. Here's how you can install a plugin:\n\n```bash\npip install livekit-plugins-openai\n```\n\nThe following plugins are available today:\n\n| Plugin                                                                             | Features                                    |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| [livekit-plugins-anthropic](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-anthropic/)   | LLM                                         |\n| [livekit-plugins-azure](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-azure/)           | STT, TTS                                    |\n| [livekit-plugins-deepgram](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-deepgram/)     | STT                                         |\n| [livekit-plugins-cartesia](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-cartesia/)     | TTS                                         |\n| [livekit-plugins-elevenlabs](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-elevenlabs/) | TTS                                         |\n| [livekit-plugins-playht](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-playht/)         | TTS                                         |\n| [livekit-plugins-google](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-google/)         | STT, TTS                                    |\n| [livekit-plugins-nltk](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-nltk/)             | Utilities for working with text             |\n| [livekit-plugins-rag](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-rag/)               | Utilities for performing RAG                |\n| [livekit-plugins-openai](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-openai/)         | LLM, STT, TTS, Assistants API, Realtime API |\n| [livekit-plugins-silero](https://pypi.org/project/livekit-plugins-silero/)         | VAD                                         |\n\n\n## Documentation and guides\n\nDocumentation on the framework and how to use it can be found [here](https://docs.livekit.io/agents)\n\n## Example agents\n\n- A basic voice agent using a pipeline of STT, LLM, and TTS [[demo](https://kitt.livekit.io) | [code](https://github.com/livekit/agents/blob/main/examples/voice-pipeline-agent/minimal_assistant.py)]\n- Voice agent using the new OpenAI Realtime API [[demo](https://playground.livekit.io) | [code](https://github.com/livekit-examples/realtime-playground)]\n- Super fast voice agent using Cerebras hosted Llama 3.1 [[demo](https://cerebras.vercel.app) | [code](https://github.com/dsa/fast-voice-assistant/)]\n- Voice agent using Cartesia's Sonic model [[demo](https://cartesia-assistant.vercel.app/)]\n- Agent that looks up the current weather via function call [[code](https://github.com/livekit/agents/blob/main/examples/voice-pipeline-agent/function_calling_weather.py)]\n- Voice agent that performs a RAG-based lookup [[code](https://github.com/livekit/agents/tree/main/examples/voice-pipeline-agent/simple-rag)]\n- Video agent that publishes a stream of RGB frames [[code](https://github.com/livekit/agents/tree/main/examples/simple-color)]\n- Transcription agent that generates text captions from a user's speech [[code](https://github.com/livekit/agents/tree/main/examples/speech-to-text)]\n- A chat agent you can text who will respond back with generated speech [[code](https://github.com/livekit/agents/tree/main/examples/text-to-speech)]\n- Localhost multi-agent conference call [[code](https://github.com/dsa/multi-agent-meeting)]\n- Moderation agent that uses Hive to detect spam/abusive video [[code](https://github.com/dsa/livekit-agents/tree/main/hive-moderation-agent)]\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe Agents framework is under active development in a rapidly evolving field.
